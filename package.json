  "description": "This repository contains the source code for a Tic Tac Toe game implemented using ReactJS. The game allows two players to play Tic Tac Toe on a 9-square board, with each player taking turns to place their mark (random number determind by a dice). The game finishes when a player has no space left on their board, and the winner is the player with the higher point. The game also includes a dice feature, where it automatically rolls a number for the player after a move has been made.",
